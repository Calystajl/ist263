    <h1>Calysta Lee's Biography</h1>
<p>
    I am a dual major student at Syracuse University, majoring in visual communications and information technology, and I am interested in journalistic multimedia storytelling. I was first introduced to photography in middle school by my 7th grade science teacher, and have since been captivated
</p>
by the world of cameras and imagery. By the time I arrived at college, I recognized the importance of having knowledge in the technological field, specifically artificial intelligence. In a world of modern communications, I must remain technologically up to date. 
<p>
    My time at Syracuse University has been enjoyable and successful so far. I made the <strong>Deans's List</strong> both semesters of my first year, and was awarded the “Curiosity and Tenacity Award” by the <strong>Alexia Foundation</strong> for my photo series “Illuminating the Self” in 2023. I assisted Washington Post photographer Marvin King on photoshoots for Academy award winning actress Regina King and for the Washington Post 2023-2024 Winter All Met Athlete shoot. I am a skilled photographer and proficient in Adobe Lightroom Classic, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Premiere Pro.

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    Outside of my responsibilities as a student, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family and eating various Asian cuisine. My favorite TV show is Criminal Minds, and my favorite book is Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom.
