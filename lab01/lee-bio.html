    <body>
        I am a dual major student in visual communications and information technology, and I am interested in journalistic multimedia storytelling.

I am a Dean’s List student at Syracuse University, and was awarded the “Curiosity and Tenacity Award” by the Alexia Foundation for my photo series “Illuminating the Self” in 2023. I assisted Washington Post photographer Marvin King on photoshoots for Academy award winning actress Regina King and for the Washington Post 2023-2024 Winter All Met Athlete shoot. I am a skilled photographer and proficient in Adobe Lightroom Classic, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Premiere Pro. 

Outside of my responsibilities as a student, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family and eating various Asian cuisine. My favorite TV show is Criminal Minds, and my favorite book is Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom.
